## Welcome to My Portfolio

If I were a student then this would be a Portfolio of some of my software, developed while a student at Western Oregon University.

### About Me (or About this Example)

This would be a good spot to say a little about yourself.  And then explain a little more about why you're doing this.

Students at Western Oregon University create a Portfolio of their work during their Senior year.  This is done as a part of the Senior Project, a year-long Software Engineering course ([CS 460](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/index.html), 461 and 462).

These pages are an example of using GitHub Pages to organize a Portfolio.  This is just an example to show students of one way to set it up.

### Code Repository

All the code seen here is hosted in a separate repository: [https://bitbucket.org/morses/seniorproject_2017-18/](https://bitbucket.org/morses/seniorproject_2017-18/)

### Software Engineering I (CS 460): Homework
