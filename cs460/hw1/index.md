## Homework 1

For this first homework, we're tasked with learning the basics of HTML and CSS, while practicing Git.  To aid in creating decent looking web pages we're also supposed to use Bootstrap, which I've learned is a popular CSS and Javascript library for page layout.

The assignment page can be found [here](http://www.wou.edu/~morses/classes/cs46x/assignments/HW1.html).  Despite the rather lengthy description, this HW is basically asking for a simple set of web pages.  

Let's get started ...

### Step 1: Download Git, Learn a Basic Workflow, Create Accounts on GitHub and Bitbucket

I've downloaded `clone`ed software from GitHub before, and browsed through code there, but I've never had to learn Git.  I downloaded the offical Git software from [Git-scm](https://git-scm.com/).  After reading some tutorials and watching a couple YouTube videos on Git I'm ready to dive in.

I first created a repository on Bitbucket, then added a README through their web interface.  To get a local copy on my machine I had to clone it and then make sure everything is set up correctly.  The instructor wants us to do everything through the command line, so we fire up Git Bash (might try the bash shell in Ubuntu inside of the Windows Subsystem for Linux next time -- *I hear it's better*):

```bash
cd Documents/CS460
mkdir repos
cd repos
git clone https://morses@bitbucket.org/morses/myprojectname.git
cd myprojectname

git config --global user.name "Scot Morse"
git config --global user.email morses@wou.edu
git config --global --edit         # to check
```

Now to add some code and see if we can `push` up to the remote server:

```bash
echo "# README" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit; create a project README"
git push -u origin master       # the -u flag adds upstream tracking reference -- will have to look this one up
```

Checking the repo webpage --> success!  Looks like I have a working repository and can add code &#9786;

### Step 2: HTML
